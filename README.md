# Dynamics-AX-Extensible-Control-Samples
Sample code and tutorials for building extensible controls for Microsoft Dynamics AX. Includes code samples for AX Forms, AX Tables, AX Classes, and AX Resources (HTML/JS/CSS).

For full API documentation, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/user-interface/extensible-control-programming-reference?toc=dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/toc.json

Note that the files with extension "xpp" are not valid X++ metadata files and cannot be opened using the Microsoft Dynamics AX Visual Studio Tools. These files have been stripped of their auto-generated metadata so that the source code is easier to read via Github. To open the files using the Microsoft Dynamics AX Visual Studio Tools, follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites to run the samples 
- You must have a Microsoft Dynamics AX developer environment (which includes a local AOS deployment). 
- The developer environment must have the Microsoft Dynamics AX Visual Studio Tools installed. These tools allow writing, viewing, compiling, and deploying the code included in these samples.

To import a sample
- Download the repository as ZIP.
- Import the desired sample project (file with extension "axpp") into Visual Studio via the menu Dynamics AX > Import Project...
